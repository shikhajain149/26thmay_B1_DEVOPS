1.What is alpine image?
A minimal Docker image based on Alpine Linux with a complete package index and only 5 MB in size!
Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox. It has access to a package repository that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images. This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications.
